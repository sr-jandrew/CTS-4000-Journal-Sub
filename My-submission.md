<h4> Abstract: </h4>
This is my "The Anatomy of a Corset" Project. I created this project as an assignment for class (CTS 2010) in my second year; we had to select a technology and create a series of projects surrounding the technology. One of the assignments was to create a map about an aspect of the technology. My technology was corsets, and I broke down each material that goes into creating one, mapping where each material would have been made.
